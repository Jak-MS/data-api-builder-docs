Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.

- There are multiple ways to access Azure Cloud Shell. To start Azure Cloud Shell:
  - Select **Try It** in a code or command block within this article. Selecting **Try it** doesn't automatically copy the code or command to Cloud Shell.
  - Go to <https://shell.azure.com>, or select **Launch Cloud Shell**.
  - Select **Cloud Shell** in the menu bar of the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>)
