> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Static Web Apps uses a fixed version of the Data API builder (DAB) engine. At any point in time, this version of the engine can lag behind the latest stable version by a couple of releases. Additionally, you cannot manually update or specify the version of the DAB engine used by Azure Static Web Apps.
>
> If you require the latest features in Data API builder or require manual control over DAB versions, consider an alternative host for the engine.
