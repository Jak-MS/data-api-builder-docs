  #Customer Intent: As a developer, I want to deploy Data API builder to Azure Container Instances so that I can quickly create a REST API for my database.

  Deploy Data API builder to Azure Container Instances
introduction: |
  Deploy the Data API builder quickly to Azure using just a configuration file and no custom code. This guide includes steps to host the Data API builder container image from Docker as a container in Azure Container Instances. 

  In this guide, walk through the steps to build a Data API builder configuration file, host the file in Azure Files, and then mount the file to a container in Azure Container Instances.
prerequisites:
  dependencies:
    - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
    - Data API builder CLI. [Install the CLI](how-to-install-cli.md).
    - Azure CLI. [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    - Existing supported database addressable from Azure.

      Build the configuration file
    summary: |
      To start, build a Data API builder (DAB) configuration file to connect to your existing database. This file is used later with the final container.
    steps:
      - |
        Initialize a new base configuration file using [`dab init`](reference-cli.md#dab-init). Use the following settings on initialization.

        | | Value |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Database type** | Select a supported database type. |
        | **Connection string** | Provide a connection string to your database. |

        ```dotnetcli
        dab init --database-type <database-type> --connection-string <connection-string>
        ```
      - |
        Add at least one database entity to the configuration. Use the [`dab add`](reference-cli.md#dab-add) command to configure an entity. Configure the entity to allow all permissions for anonymous users.

        ```dotnetcli
        dab add <entity-name> --source <schema>.<table> --permissions "anonymous:*"
        ```

      Host configuration in Azure Files
    summary: |
      Next, upload the configuration file to a file share created within Azure Files. This file share is eventually mounted to the final container as a volume.

      Create the container instance
    summary: |
      Finally, create the container in Azure using Azure Container Instances. This container hosts the Data API builder image and use the configuration file from the Azure Files mount to connect to your database.
