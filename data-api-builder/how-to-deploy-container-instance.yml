  #Customer Intent: As a developer, I want to deploy Data API builder to Azure Container Instances so that I can quickly create a REST API for my database.

  Deploy Data API builder to Azure Container Instances
introduction: |
  Deploy the Data API builder quickly to Azure using just a configuration file and no custom code. This guide includes steps to host the Data API builder container image from Docker as a container in Azure Container Instances. 

  In this guide, walk through the steps to build a Data API builder configuration file, host the file in Azure Files, and then mount the file to a container in Azure Container Instances.
prerequisites:
  dependencies:
    - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
    - Data API builder CLI. [Install the CLI](how-to-install-cli.md).
    - Azure CLI. [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    - Existing supported database addressable from Azure.

      Build the configuration file
    summary: |
      To start, build a Data API builder (DAB) configuration file to connect to your existing database. This file is used later with the final container.
    steps:
      - |
        Create an empty directory on your local machine to store the configuration file.
      - |
        Initialize a new base configuration file using [`dab init`](reference-cli.md#init). Use the following settings at a minimum on initialization.

        | Setting | Value |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Database type** | Select a supported database type. |
        | **Connection string** | Use the [`@env()`](reference-functions.md#env) function to reference the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. |

        ```dotnetcli
        dab init --database-type "<database-type>" --connection-string "@env('DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING')"
        ```

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Some database types will require additional configuration settings on initialization.
      - |
        Add at least one database entity to the configuration. Use the [`dab add`](reference-cli.md#add) command to configure an entity. Configure each entity to allow all permissions for anonymous users. Repeat `dab add` as many times as you like for your entities.

        ```dotnetcli
        dab add "<entity-name>" --source "<schema>.<table>" --permissions "anonymous:*"
        ```
      - |
        Open and review the contents of the *dab-config.json* file. You use this file later in this guide.
      - |
        Create a new file in the same directory named *schema.graphql*. Insert the following content into the file and **save** the file. You also use this file later in this guide.

        ```graphql
        type Author @model {
          id: ID
          firstName: String
          lastName: String
        }
        ```
  - title: |
      Host configuration in Azure Files
    summary: |
      Next, upload the configuration file to a file share created within Azure Files. This file share is eventually mounted to the final container as a volume.
    steps:
      - |
        Sign into the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).
      - |
        Create a new resource group. You will use this resource group to for all new resources in this guide.

        > [!TIP]
        > We recommend naming the resource group **msdocs-dab-aci**. All screenshots in this guide use this name.
      - |
        Create an Azure Storage account. Use these settings to configure the account.

        | Setting | Value |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Resource group** | Select the resource group you created earlier |
        | **Storage account name** | Enter a globally unique name |
        | **Region** | Select an Azure region |
        | **Performance** | Select **Standard** |
        | **Redundancy** | Select **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** |
        | **Enable storage account key access** | Select **Enabled** |

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-container-instance/create-storage-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Create a storage account' page's 'Advanced' tab in the Azure portal.":::
      - |
        Navigate to the new storage account in the Azure portal.
      - |
        Select **File shares** in the **Data storage** section of the resource menu. Then, select **File share** from the command bar to create a new share in the storage account. Use the following settings to configure the new file share.

        | Setting | Value |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Name** | Enter `config` |
        | **Access tier** | Select **Hot** |
        | **Enable backup** | Do not select |

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-container-instance/storage-file-share-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **File share** resource menu and command bar options in the Azure portal.":::
      - |
        Upload the *dab-config.json* and *schema.graphql* files to the share. Use the **Upload** option in the command bar to open the **Upload files** dialog. Select both files and then select **Upload**.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-container-instance/upload-files.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Upload files** dialog in the Azure portal.":::
      - |
        Select **Access keys** in the **Security + networking** section of the resource menu. Then, record the **Storage account name** and **Key** values from this page. You will use these values later in this guide.

      Create the base container instance
    summary: |
      Now, create the container in Azure using Azure Container Instances. This container hosts the Data API builder image without a configuration.

      Mount the configuration files
    summary: |
      Finally, mount the configuration files from the Azure Files share to the container instance. This step allows the Data API builder to use the configuration file to connect to your database.

      Clean up resources
    summary: |
      When you no longer need the sample application or resources, remove the corresponding deployment and all resources.
    steps:
      - |
        Navigate to the **resource group** using the Azure portal.
      - |
        In the **command bar**, select **Delete**.
